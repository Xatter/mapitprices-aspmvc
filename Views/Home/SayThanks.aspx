<p>Thanks for signing up for our awesome startup!</p>
<p>Wow I can't believe I actually got your email address.  Oh man, I'm going to email you like a million times a day with all kinds of SPAM, just like that guy you gave your phone number to who wouldn't stop calling that time! Wait until I tell the guys who run the SPAM bot about this...</p>
<p>Oh.. actually it looks like the SPAM bot is broken at the moment... jeez this is really embarassing. Err... How about instead we do what we said we were going to do and just tell you when you can get into the Beta and download the Android App?  Like, with links and stuff. K?</p>
<p>I'd appreciate if you didn't mention the SPAM bot being broken to anyone. kthxbye</p>
